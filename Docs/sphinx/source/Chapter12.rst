AMReX-based Profiling Tools
===========================

AMReX-based application codes can be instrumented using AMReX-specific
performance profiling tools that take into account the hierarchical nature of
the mesh in most AMReX-based applications. These codes can be instrumented for
varying levels of profiling detail.

Here are links to short courses (slides) on how to use the profiling tools.
More details can be found in the documentation below.
